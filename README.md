# ALX_powerbi_projects
Moulding data into visual stories in Maji Ndogo is the second project and it's all about changing the data into insightful visuals and discovering the relationships between the tables to be able to help the  Maji Ndogo people to fix the water problem.Weâ€™ll import tables separately, clean data, and set up a working relational data model in PowerBI. We will also recreate our visuals with the new data model, and see how the new model affected our visuals. Our goal is to refine the visuals, customising text, colours, and fonts to make the visuals clear and simple.

Communicating our findings in Maji Ndogo is the third project we really need to see the problem at the provincial level. The provincial leaders I appointed are in the best position to make decisions about
their province, so we should have some way for them to understand where they will need to spend their funds,the number of improvements in the provincial level and source type and also the cost of the budgets in the  provincial level and source type. We will use DAX to create measures and columns to enrich our data to ensure accurate and useful data representation on the dashboard.
